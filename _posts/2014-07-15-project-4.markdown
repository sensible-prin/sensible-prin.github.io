description: SENSIBLE aims to empower pandemic preparedness by building a general system for the genomic surveillance of pathogens in current and future viral human epidemics. The main outcome of the project will be an automated early warning system, based on data-driven analysis of small data, which will act as early as possible, to identify emerging viral pathogens and/or novel lineages of known pathogens that might pose an immediate risk for human health.
SENSIBLE aims to pave the way to a better strategy of genomic surveillance. To pursue this ambitious aim, we will target two settings:
– Regional settings, which need to properly monitor epidemics in their local territory and organize alerting methods for the bigger (country-level) organizations. Lombardia, the region of Italy where the COVID-19 pandemic originally spread, will provide the ideal use case for this scenario.
– Low-resources settings. The WHO has recently analyzed the context of a number of African countries where attempts to monitor COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 evolution have been undermined by under-staffed infrastructures and lack of resources.
