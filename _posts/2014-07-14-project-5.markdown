description: SENSIBLE aims to shift current paradigms in pathogens genomic surveillance. We move away from the
traditional approach based purely on monitoring of the prevalence of viral variants and lineages, based on big data and,
instead, we propose an integrated approach, that by leveraging a collection of different key evolutionary and
epidemiological features will allow a more complete understanding of an epidemic, produce more informative results, and
without the need for a large amounts of data.
We will tackle two key epidemiological questions and identify key metrics for raising alerts and early warnings in both
scenarios:
– Minimal actionable data. What is the minimal amount of data production/availability required to set up an effective
surveillance system? Can genomic surveillance be applied even in scarce/low resources settings? Notwithstanding the
recent experience with COVID-19, these questions remain largely unanswered. We aim to provide resource-aware
recommendations/guidelines and quantifiable metrics to assist health authorities in the set-up of “minimal” pathogen’s
surveillance systems.
– Prioritization/ranking of emerging pathogens. If a new mutation or pattern of mutations arise in a human pathogen, how
does this impact its epidemiological features? Our first focus in this case are changes that may provoke increased
transmissibility, contagiousness, infectivity or immune system evasion. We plan to build a scoring system to rank and
prioritize emerging virus/viral variants with enhanced epidemiological features.
